# About

A practical beginners guide to learning **Barba.js** for setting up page transitions using **GSAP** for animations.  

# Instructions

You'll need to have **node** and **npm** installed on your system to make this work.
There is plenty of documentation to help get this setup on your machine.

This guide is arranged with git branches, because that is how I put this together.
You will need to understand how to [checkout git branches](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/git-checkout)

As you checkout each branch you can see the code in your editor to follow along.
Run **npm run server** to start up a local dev server in your browser.
Make changes to the code, save the file and see the changes in your browser!

1. Dowload or Clone from [repo](https://github.com/telagraphic/page-transitions).
2. Run **npm install** in your terminal to install dependencies.
3. Run **npm run server** to start a local dev server.
